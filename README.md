# gh_victr

Database Setup
========================
1. Included is the table repos.sql file.
2. Create a database named victr.
3. Create a user / pass for that database with all privelages. user = victr / pass = victr.

App Build
=========================
I'm using just PHP, MySQL, javascript, and jQuery.
The application is built using a Github class, and most the requests / content is done in javascript using ajax.
The javascript is built around using prototype in jQuery, and built in a OOP orientation.
Mysql is using PDO for the great tools it supplies.


Any other questions may feel free to be directed towards me. I used javascript heavily this time to show a different way other then
cURL to pull from the github api.

And how would this readme end if not again a sincere thank you for not only giving me a small project to work on, but for giving
me another opportunity for a position.
